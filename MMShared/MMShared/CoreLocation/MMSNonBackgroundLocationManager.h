//Use in an app that supports background location whem you also want a location manager
//that won't keep run the app in the background. E.g. for the Radar view in WiFiFoFum
//when on that view and the app backgrounds you don't want that to keep it running in background.

//Note: you still should stop/start yourself on view willAppear/willDissapear.

// Redesign, shouldn't be a subclass.
